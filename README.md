â€”â†’ **Media Player Customization**: (Both Horizontal and Vertical Docks Supported!)
- This theme allows to customize the behavior of the dock's player and add filters to it and the toolbar media module's player. And makes coveres fully take the space.

  - **Compact Mode**: Unless hovered, the Media Player stays at your set item size. (***Default***)
  - **Always Expanded Mode**: By matching hovered and unhovered state values, you can make the Media Player always expanded like default, if you wish to use the other features, but not the above.
  - **Smart Player Mode**: You can set it so the Media Player hides when no media is playing. Along with this, you can set the relevant seperator (left or right) to follow the same logic so it is fully clean.
